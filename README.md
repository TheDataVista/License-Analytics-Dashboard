📊 Power BI Dashboard – Licensing Data Analysis

This project explores how to transform business licensing data into actionable insights using Power BI.
Licensing data can often be complex, scattered, and overwhelming, but with interactive dashboards, we can uncover trends, monitor compliance, and support smarter decision-making.

Geography – A map view showcasing where licenses are concentrated globally.

Status Monitoring – Breakdown of active, expired, cancelled, and abandoned licenses.

Time Analysis – License issuance trends year over year.

Details View – Drill-through page for granular license-level information.
